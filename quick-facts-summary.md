This document tries to condense important parts of a vegan nutrition


**Vitamins**

B12 is required supplement. Everyone (even non-vegans) need to intake it regularily to avoid health issues.

**Fatty acids**

Omega 9 is non essential fat. Body can make it on our own.

While Omega 6 - LA (linoleic acid) and Omega 3 - ALA (alpha-linolenic acid) are essential fats that we need to intake.

- Ideal Omega 6 : Omega 3 ratio should be 4:1 or better
- Avoid Omega 6 rich/dominant oils to avoid disbalancing the ratio
- Always go for Omega 3 dominant foods
